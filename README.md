# ChessChampionshipAnalysis

## Introduction

This project was made to produce insights on the Hungarian Chess Championship. <br>

In order to get the necessary data, I made a webscraper to scrape the last 5 season's data. This scraper will not be included in this repository. I made sure to check the website's robots.txt, and it did not disallow scraping. <br>

In the long term, I would like to get some insights on what makes a player perform well in a season/game, how things unrelated to chess (like how early a game starts, travel time etc.) affect the result of the game. <br>

Note: The notebook is still a bit messy, I will tidy it up soon. :)
