# ChessChampionshipAnalysis

## Introduction

This project was made to produce insights on the Hungarian Chess Championship. <br>
In order to get the necessary data, I made a webscraper to scrape the last 5 season's data. This scraper will not be included in this repository. <br>
In the long term, I would like to get some insights on what makes a player perform well in a season/game, how things unrelated to chess (like how early a game starts, travel time etc.) affect the result of the game.
